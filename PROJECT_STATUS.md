# My-Site Chat App - Project Status (v4.4.5)

## 🎯 MAIN ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Infinite Location Detection Loop
- **Problem:** Site was constantly reloading every 2 seconds due to location detection
- **Solution:** Removed `ip-detection.js` completely, added simple `detectLocationOnce()` function
- **Result:** Site loads normally, no more constant reloading

### 2. Missing JavaScript Functions
- **Problem:** Many buttons not working due to missing functions
- **Solution:** Added `sendMessage()`, fixed all modal functions, made async functions properly async
- **Result:** All buttons now functional

### 3. Duplicate Friends Section
- **Problem:** Friends section appeared twice in left sidebar
- **Solution:** Removed from left sidebar, moved to right sidebar
- **Result:** Clean layout with proper organization

### 4. Script Loading Issues
- **Problem:** Scripts not loading in correct order
- **Solution:** Fixed HTML script order, removed `advanced-features.js`
- **Result:** All scripts load properly

### 5. Language Switching Not Working
- **Problem:** Selecting countries didn't change language (US→English, FR→French)
- **Solution:** Fixed `selectLocation()` function to use `country-data.js` language mapping
- **Result:** Language changes correctly based on country selection

### 6. City Selection Missing
- **Problem:** Only capital cities were selectable, no city choice for users
- **Solution:** Added `selectCountry()` and `showCitySelectionModal()` functions with city search
- **Result:** Users can now select any city from a searchable list

### 7. GitHub Security Issue
- **Problem:** Potential security issue with Telegram bot code
- **Solution:** Searched and found no actual Telegram bot code, only "HeponBot" references
- **Result:** No security issues found
