# Random Chat Site

This project provides a simple example site where two random visitors can have a one-time chat.
It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript on the front-end and a small Java HTTP server.

## Run

Compile and start the server:

```
javac src/ChatServer.java
java -cp src ChatServer
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in two different browser windows to test the chat.
